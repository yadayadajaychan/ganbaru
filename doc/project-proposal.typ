== Brief Description
Ganbaru is a question and answer site for students enrolled in a class,
where students can ask and answer questions pertaining to the course material.
For each question, there is a section for the instructor answer and
a section for the student answer(s).
Answers can be voted on and the top voted student answer appears at the top
(directly under the instructor answer).
Comments can be left under each answer.
Students can also act anonymously or pseudo-anonymously (under an alias),
but instructors will be able to view their true identity.
Students can also search through the asked questions and filter by tags.
